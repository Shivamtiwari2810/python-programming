    " * Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) that allows us to focus on essential features of an object rather than representing its complexity. It is the process of hiding complex implementation details and providing only the necessary information to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOPs, Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method, and it can't be instantiated. An abstract method is a method that doesn't have any implementation, and its body is left empty. The implementation of an abstract method is left to its subclasses. Interfaces, on the other hand, are a collection of abstract methods and can't be instantiated. They define a set of behaviors that a class can implement.\n",
    "\n",
    " *  example to understand Abstraction better. Suppose we want to design a program for a car rental company. We can create an abstract class called \"Vehicle,\" which contains common properties of all vehicles such as \"make,\" \"model,\" \"color,\" \"year,\" etc. The Vehicle class can also have some abstract methods like \"start,\" \"stop,\" \"accelerate,\" and \"brake.\" These methods can be implemented differently for different types of vehicles like a car, a truck, or a bike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can create subclasses of the Vehicle class, such as \"Car,\" \"Truck,\" and \"Bike,\" and provide the implementation for the abstract methods. For instance, the \"start\" method for a car can be different from a bike, and hence the respective subclass can implement the \"start\" method accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, Abstraction allows us to focus on the essential properties and behaviors of an object and hide the unnecessary details. It also enables us to make changes to the underlying implementation without affecting the rest of the program."

    " * Abstraction and Encapsulation are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) that help to organize and manage code effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding complexity and providing only the essential features to the user. It focuses on the behavior of an object and its essential properties, while hiding the underlying implementation details. Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the process of wrapping data and behavior within a single unit or object. It provides data hiding by preventing direct access to the internal data of an object from outside. Encapsulation can be achieved through access modifiers such as private, public, protected.\n",
