    "'r': This mode opens the file in read-only mode. You can only read the contents of the file in this mode, and you cannot modify or write to the file. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w': This mode opens the file in write-only mode. If the file already exists, the contents of the file will be deleted. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. You can write to the file in this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a': This mode opens the file in append mode. If the file already exists, the contents of the file will be preserved, and new data will be added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. You can write to the file in this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x': This mode opens the file in exclusive creation mode. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError will be raised. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. You can write to the file in this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b': This mode opens the file in binary mode. This mode is used for reading and writing binary data, such as images or other non-text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t': This mode opens the file in text mode. This is the default mode if no mode is specified. This mode is used for reading and writing text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+': This mode opens the file in both read and write mode. This mode is used for updating an existing file."
